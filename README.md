# duoxiao-log
A hardware keylogger made from two xiaos


### Cancelled project 
Too simple for grounded. Won't be sent to fab by me.
The Kicad design files for this project are near complete, and should function if someone ever makes them.
I may publish them on this repo shortly.

The firmware has not been touched but if I implement a breadboard version, I'll publish the files on this repo.
